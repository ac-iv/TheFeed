                <p>
                     Living in such a big city, I find it hard to find peace among all the noise and crowding; I find it a lot of fun to get out and explore quieter areas. So since moving here, I have spent time going on maps, and looking for my next adventure! Whether its North, South, or East, Apple maps is what gets me there.

                    Since I am always on the go, my driving experience means a lot to me; technology obviously playing a significant role in that. My favorite thing in my car (aside form its amazing speakers) is the big backup camera that has done me very well.

                    As a Tech nut, I am always looking for ways to integrate tech into my life. My most recent "obsession" has been focused on home automation and mainstreaming all home controls into one app, which, for me, is the Home App built into Apple OS.

                    Photoshop is an app I have been using more and more as my design knowledge expands. Recently, I have been experimenting with Photoshop Beta, and the possibilities there.

                    Spotify is great, but for an authentic music listening experience, I prefer to play music through my Sony Record Player. I made a coffee table to accommodate the dimensions of the player, and use it as my primary coffee table.

                    I love my kindle, for travel primarily. Whenever I am in the city, I prefer paper. However, when I was traveling this summer, I only brought this kindle and it was amazing. I found a site that gave me free books so it was very economical for the travel.

                    My workspace is very important to me as it is where I complete 98% of my schoolwork. I have it situated overlooking a window, to make sure I get a lot of natural light. My monitor is a vintage, apple cinema display, and my computer is a contemporary 14 inch MacBook Pro. I set my screensaver as a photo collage and it is my favorite way to reflect on memories and images.
