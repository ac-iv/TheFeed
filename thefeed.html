                <p> When I first moved to SF, I spent a lot of time exploring the land and familiarizing myself with the bay area. From a coastal town, I found myself very drawn toward the ocean, and found a natural home at Ocean Beach.</p>

                <p>This summer, I backpacked through Europe, and spent a significant time in Paris. While I was there, I hosted a few visitors in my Air BNB, friends and family from home. During the part of the trip when my cousin was there, we spent a lot of time touristing and taking pics of each other hehe</p>

                <h3>2023</h3>
                <p>On my trip in Europe this summer, I also stopped in Florence, Italy. I was motivated to do so because this is where my great-grandfather immigrated from. As an Architecture minor, I am constantly studying the buildings around me. When I got to Florence, I was very astounded and impressed by the main cathedral in the city. The material, size, and architecture of the church was something I had never experienced before. </p>

                <p>This April, I was surprised with a ticket to the Coachella Music Festival. I rushed down on the first day of the festival, and found a camping spot with my friend from SF. It was an incredibly spontaneous trip, but I am really glad I made it. </p>

            <p>At the Danish music festival, I met the kindest people in the show crowds, and many of the would dance with me! I always love music festival crowds, people are so friendly and eager to make friends. However, its hard to f ind someone to dance with!
